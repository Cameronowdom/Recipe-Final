        <h1>Four Cheese Grilled-Cheese Sandwich</h1>
        
        <h2> The best grilled cheese! Using garlic butter, hot/mild giardiniera, spinach, tomatoes, and 4 different kinds of Italian cheeses, you'll take a second look at the next grilled cheese sandwich you decide to make!</h2>
        <div>
        
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons salted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 thick slices italian bread</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup giardiera, drained</li>
            <li>2 slices mozzerella cheese</li>
            <li>2 slices provolone cheese</li>
            <li>2 slices Asiago cheese</li>
            <li>2 slices Fontina Cheese</li>
            <li>2 slices of Roma tomato</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
        
        <ol>
            <li>Mix butter and garlic in a small bowl until well combined. Spread 1/2 of the butter onto one side of each slice of bread; set aside.</li>
            
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat; stir in spinach and giardiniera. Saute until spinach is wilted and mixture is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a bowl and wipe out the skillet.</li>
            
            <li>Place 1 slice of bread, buttered-side down, into one side of the warm skillet. Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in the other side of the skillet. Place mozzarella slices in the skillet and cook until soft, 1 to 2 minutes. Place mozzarella slices on top of the bread in the skillet. Repeat with the provolone, Asiago, and Fontina slices.</li>
            
            <li>Add spinach mixture and tomato slices to the skillet, adding more oil if necessary, and cook until warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Place spinach mixture on top of the cheese, followed by the tomatoes and the remaining slice of bread, buttered-side up. Flip the sandwich and cook until browned and cheese has melted, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
